# Gia il sole dal Gange
## Piano
## 120 beats per minute
This is a practice version. The piece is to be performed at approximately 153 beats per minute.

**This is not a live performance.**

This was constructed measure-by-measure using a combination of an Alesis Concert 88-key MIDI controller plugged into a MacBook Pro 2020 running Logic Pro X. I did not learn the piano part. I am currently practicing the vocals.

I was presented with this piece thirteen (13) days ago by my vocal coach. 

Today is November 9th, 2022.

This is a Canzonetta written by Scarlatti when he was nineteen (19) years old.

It was performed for royalty.

I don't know if it was performed by royalty.

Might have been the hired help.
